### üî• About

<p>I developed a landing page for a private painting works business using SCSS, TypeScript, and Next.js. The project features an API endpoint with Nodemailer for seamless contact form submissions. This experience enhanced my skills in modern web development, including responsive design, server-side rendering (SSR), SEO optimization, client-server communication, and efficient email handling.</p>

### üå∂Ô∏è Why This Tech Stack:

* **SCSS:** I chose SCSS for its powerful features like nesting, variables, and mixins, which make writing and maintaining CSS more efficient and organized. SCSS allows for reusable and modular styles, improving the overall maintainability of the codebase.

* **TypeScript** was selected for its ability to provide static type checking, which helps catch errors early in the development process. It enhances code quality and maintainability by offering better tooling and robust type definitions, making the development process smoother and more predictable.

* **Next.js** was the framework of choice for its support for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). These features significantly enhance the performance and SEO of the landing page. Next.js also simplifies routing and API endpoint creation, making it ideal for building modern, performant web applications.

* **Nodemailer** was integrated to handle email submissions from the contact form. Its simplicity and reliability make it an excellent choice for sending emails in Node.js applications. By using Nodemailer, I ensured that users could easily reach out through the website, improving the user experience and engagement.

By leveraging SCSS, TypeScript, Next.js, and Nodemailer, I was able to create a high-performance, maintainable, and SEO-optimized landing page that meets modern web development standards.
